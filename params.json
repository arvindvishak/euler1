  "body": "### Welcome to Euler 1.\r\nBeing a Computer Scientist, I am interested in exploring programming languages. And so I've taken up the exercise of writing the same simple program in multiple languages, to get a feel for the differences between them and actually using them. So, I've taken up the exercise of coding up a trivial program in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nThe program I've chosen is <a href=\"http://projecteuler.net/problem=1\">Problem 1</a> from <a href=\"http://projecteuler.net\">Project Euler</a>. This is an introductory problem, simply meant to get one's feet wet with actually writing and executing a program. It entails finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 less than 1000. Like I said, simple. However, even something this simple still requires one to figure out how to do a number of integral programming operations, such as IF conditions, loops, printing output, etc. This blog will explore my efforts.\r\n\r\nI'll be using Linux for my coding. For each language, I'll be detailing my experience in getting the code compiled and executed.",
